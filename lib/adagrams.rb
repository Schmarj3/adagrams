# - No parameters
# - Returns an array of ten strings
# - Each string should contain exactly one letter
# - These represent the hand of letters that the player has drawn
# - The letters should be randomly drawn from a pool of letters
# - This letter pool should reflect the distribution of letters as described in the table below
# - There are only 2 available `C` letters, so `draw_letters` cannot ever return more than 2 `C`s
# - Since there are 12 `E`s but only 1 `Z`, it should be 12 times as likely for the user to draw an `E` as a `Z`
# - Invoking this method should **not** change the pool of letters
# - Imagine that the user returns their hand to the pool before drawing new letters

# To do so, add a method called `uses_available_letters?` in `adagrams.rb`. This method should have the following properties:
#
#- Has two parameters:
#   - `input`, the first parameter, describes some input word, and is a string
# - `letters_in_hand`, the second parameter, describes an array of drawn letters in a hand. You can expect this to be an array of ten strings, with each string representing a letter
# - Returns either `true` or `false`
# - Returns `true` if every letter in the `input` word is available (in the right quantities) in the `letters_in_hand`
# - Returns `false` if not; if there is a letter in `input` that is not present in the `letters_in_hand` or has too much of compared to the `letters_in_hand`
#

# Name this method `score_word` in `adagrams.rb`. This method should have the following properties:
# - Has one parameter: `word`, which is a string of characters
# - Returns an integer representing the number of points
# - Each letter within `word` has a point value. The number of points of each letter is summed up to represent the total score of `word`
# - Each letter's point value is described in the table below
# - If the length of the word is 7, 8, 9, or 10, then the word gets an additional 8 points
